# Discord.js Base bot
### Made by [BlazeCoding](https://blazecoding.me/)

Want to make a discord bot but can't find a good command/event structure?
Use this! It has a good command handler. There are some tweaks which probably need to be made, but I'll do that later

## Configuration

Guessing that you downloaded, unzipped and opened the folder in your favorite code editor, we need to configure some stuff.
1. Rename the `config.yml.example` file to `config.yml`
2. Edit the values and put in your discord token, your Discord Bot ID, your Discord account ID etc
3. Run `npm install` to install all the necessary packages needed for the base (You can add more later on.)
And you're done! 

## Adding Commands

(Coming soon!)

## Adding Events
